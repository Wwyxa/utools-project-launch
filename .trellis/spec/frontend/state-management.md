# State Management

> How state is managed in this project.

---

## Overview

Pinia is the only global state layer in the app. `src/store/useStore.ts` owns the current project catalog, selected project id, terminal logs, staged file data, todos, and memo content.

Local UI state stays inside components when it only affects one panel or one interaction, such as the active tab in `ProjectDetails.vue` or the copied state in `Terminal.vue`.

---

## State Categories

Current categories:

- local UI state: tab selection, copied flags, scroll references, input text
- global app state: selected project, project list, logs, staged files, todo list, memo content
- derived state: `selectedProject` getter in the store
- server state: none today
- URL state: none today

---

## When to Use Global State

Promote state to the store when multiple views need the same data or one view must update another view immediately.

Good candidates in the current app include:

- selected project id
- project status changes
- log output visible in the terminal panel
- memo and todo content shared across tabs
- project form drafts, because create/edit flows update multiple panels and store-owned domain state
- preload bridge results such as Git snapshots and running process metadata

Do not move purely visual state into the store if a component can manage it locally.

---

## Server State

There is no server state cache today. All data is in-memory and seeded in the store.

If the app later talks to a real backend or file system adapter, keep the fetched data behind a store action or composable so the UI does not need to care where it came from.

The current uTools integration follows this rule: UI components call store actions, store actions call `src/lib/projectBridge.ts`, and the bridge delegates to `window.projectBridge` from `public/preload.js` when running inside uTools.

## Scenario: Project Catalog Persistence

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: project catalog data crosses the Vue store, browser fallback, and uTools preload storage boundary.

### 2. Signatures

- `ProjectBridge.loadProjects(): Promise<Project[]>`
- `ProjectBridge.saveProjects(projects: Project[]): Promise<void>`
- `ProjectBridge.inspectProjectPath(projectPath: string): Promise<ProjectPathInspection>`
- `ProjectBridge.exportProjects(payload: ProjectExportPayload): Promise<void>`
- `ProjectBridge.importProjects(): Promise<ProjectImportPayload | null>`

### 3. Contracts

- In uTools, persist the project catalog as one `utools.db` document per project, not as one whole-catalog `dbStorage` key. Use a stable prefix such as `utools-project-launch/project/<projectId>` so cloud sync conflicts stay localized to individual projects.
- When updating existing uTools db documents, read/preserve `_rev` before `put`; when deleting projects, remove only documents under the project prefix that are absent from the current catalog.
- In a real uTools bridge environment, do not seed `demoProjects` before persistence loading in a way that can mask empty or failed storage reads. Demo data is only for browser/no-bridge preview.
- Persist only sync-safe project metadata: ids, names, paths, kind/type, descriptions, scripts, environment values, memo, timestamps, and schema version.
- Do not persist local runtime state such as running script status, process ids, transient logs, or stale Git snapshots.
- Treat path availability as device-derived state. A project whose path is missing on the current device remains in the catalog but is classified as unavailable until edited to a valid path.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Storage unavailable -> return an empty project list or no-op save in fallback mode; do not crash UI startup.
- Old single-key `dbStorage` data exists but no project db docs exist -> load the legacy payload once and migrate it into per-project db documents when uTools db is available.
- uTools `allDocs` returns rows, docs, ids, or wrapper objects -> normalize to project doc ids and read full docs with `db.get` when needed; skip error-shaped results.
- Path inspection fails -> preserve manual form editing and show feedback; do not block save only because inspection failed.
- Imported JSON has unsupported shape -> reject/skip invalid records and report the import result.
- Duplicate import candidate -> skip or merge explicitly; never silently overwrite an existing project.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: synced project lands on another device with a missing path, appears in the unavailable section, and can be restored by editing the path.
- Base: browser preview uses local fallback storage and keeps the same store actions as uTools.
- Bad: saving the entire synced catalog into one `dbStorage` key, making cloud conflicts overwrite unrelated projects.
- Bad: saving `RUNNING` script state or `pid` to uTools storage, then restoring it as if the process still existed.

### 6. Tests Required

- Build/type-check should prove the bridge contract stays in sync across `src/types.ts`, `src/lib/projectBridge.ts`, and store actions.
- Manual uTools smoke test should cover create, reload, import/export, missing-path display, and path restoration.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
await bridge.saveProjects(this.projects);
```

This can leak local runtime details into synchronized storage.

#### Correct

```ts
await bridge.saveProjects(this.projects.map((project) => toPersistedProject(project)));
```

Normalize projects before crossing the persistence boundary.

## Common Mistakes

- Duplicating the same project data in multiple components
- Storing view-only toggles in the global store
- Assuming store data persists across reloads
- Mutating nested records in ad hoc ways outside the store actions
- Letting derived state drift instead of reading from a getter
- Calling `window.projectBridge` directly from feature components instead of going through store actions
- Persisting device-local runtime state, such as script `pid` or `RUNNING` status, into synced project catalog storage

## Scenario: Script Runtime Status

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: command execution crosses the store and preload process boundary.

### 2. Signatures

- `ProjectBridge.runCommand(...)` starts a process and returns a runtime `pid`.
- `ProjectBridge.stopProcess(pid)` stops that runtime process.
- `ProjectBridgeEvent` with `type: "exit"` may include `stoppedByUser`.

### 3. Contracts

- User-initiated stop must set the script to `STOPPED`, even if the operating system reports a non-zero exit code after killing the process tree.
- Only non-user-stopped exits with non-zero codes should become `ERROR`.
- Project card status should be derived from all scripts: any running script -> `RUNNING`; otherwise any error script -> `ERROR`; otherwise stopped/idle scripts -> `STOPPED`.
- Script order is user-controlled metadata and must be preserved by create/edit forms, persistence, import/export, and details display.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Stop requested with missing pid -> converge UI to stopped if the script is not running at the preload layer.
- Duplicate start request for a running script -> ignore it.
- Empty command -> do not start.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: user clicks stop, the process exits with a kill code, and UI shows stopped.
- Base: one script stops while another keeps running, and the project card remains running.
- Bad: treating every non-zero exit after `taskkill` as an application error.

### 6. Tests Required

- Type-check event payload changes across `src/types.ts`, store handlers, and preload events.
- Manual smoke test: start a long-running command, stop it, confirm script and card show stopped.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
script.status = event.code === 0 ? "STOPPED" : "ERROR";
```

#### Correct

```ts
script.status = event.stoppedByUser || event.code === 0 ? "STOPPED" : "ERROR";
```
